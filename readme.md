# Reactor

Ractor is an event system based and multiple stores architecture state management for frontend app that inspired by Redux and Akka Actor.

## Motivation

I'm big fan of Redux. It's concept is perfect but i don't like something in Redux.

### Pure Reducer

I know pure is good(eg. suitable for test and debug). But it's a little tied to separate a impure action to two files(reducer and middleware). It's more convenient for me or other people to write the impure actions in most scenarios. Pure and Impure has its own advantages. I tend to write impure ”reducer“ due to the es7 asynchronous function.

### Dialog problem

Imagine you have a page A and a component Dialog rendered in A. In A, you have a button that want to tell Dialog to open. Now switch page A to page B, you should to unmount Dialog.

How do you do this with redux?

In Redux way, you need to initialize a Dialog state in redux store. But if switch A to B, Dialog has unmounted, the Dialog state is still in redux store. It's the problem.

In Ractor way, we can dynamic mount and unmount the "reducer".

## Install

```sh
npm i ractor
```

## Quick Start

Ractor builds upon three main ideas.

### System

System is an event system. Normally, You need to create one for your logic app.

```ts
import { System } from "ractor";
export const system = new System("counter");
```

### Message

The abstraction of system behavior. You can create it by class.

```ts
export class Increment {}
```

### Store

Conceptually, your can think of Store like a event handler or redux’s reducer.

Store is an abstract class, abstract method createReceive needs to return an Receive object. There is a convenient helper method `receiveBuilder` to help you to create Receive object

```ts
import { Increment } from "./Increment";
import { Decrement } from "./Decrement";
import { Store } from "ractor";

export class CounterStore extends Store<{ value: number }> {
  public state = { value: 1 };
  public createReceive() {
    return this.receiveBuilder()
      .match(Increment, async () =>
        this.setState({ value: this.state.value + 1 }))
      .match(Decrement, async () =>
        this.setState({ value: this.state.value + 1 }))
      .build();
    }
}
```

## React

With react, we can use [ractor-react](https://github.com/huangbinjie/ractor-react) to connect react component to ractor event system.

### Provider

The Provider is a hight order component to connect system and stores. Then provide the event system to our react app. You need to use it once when you render the root component.

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "ractor-react";
import { system } from "./system";
import { CounterStore } from "./CounterStore";
import { Counter } from "./Counter";

render(
  <Provider system={system} stores={[CounterStore]}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Providers

The Providers is also a HOC. Providers can subscribe multiple stores that you passed. When you call setState in one of them, you component will receive the new state.

```ts
import { Providers } from "ractor-react";
import { CounterStore } from "./CounterStore";

@Providers([ CounterStore ])
export class Counter extends React.Component<{ value?: number }>
```

### Dispatch

Dispatch message to system is also simple.

```ts
import { system } from "./system";

system.dispatch(new Increment());
```
